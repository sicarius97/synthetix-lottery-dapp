# synthetix-lottery-dapp

This is a project created for the Synthetix Bounty Hackathon where I will be attempting to create an Ethereum Smart Contract that accepts sUSD for the purposes of taking part in a lottery. This contract will accept the sUsd, mint a lottery ticket NFT, pick 3 random winners every 6 hours, and then allow the use of that NFT for claiming a prize if a user wins.
